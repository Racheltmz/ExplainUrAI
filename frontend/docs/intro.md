# Introduction

ExplainUrAI is a tool to explain your AI models through visualisations. The supported deep learning tasks are image classification and text classification. While the supported classical learning tasks are regression and classification.

The documentation will state what files you need to use, the file format to use, and the current limitations of the tool for each machine learning task.

## Benefits of XAI

AI algorithms have achieved great performance in numerous tasks. However, with the complexity of the algorithm, it is difficult to understand how the model derives its decision. This lack of transparency has resulted in issues such as model bias. However, with the introduction of XAI, we now have ways to understand how a model works make informed decisions when choosing which model to use.
